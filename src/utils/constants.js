    Watching the beloveds pain and torment
    Come to an end.  Will anyone come?
    Or am I left to experience this alone
    
    I   
    Wish I could show you what you meant to me
    I   
    Wish i had more time to spend with
    You
    Your world's coming down in front of me
    You 
    Sit and ponder, lost, trapped in your memories
    your memories (Agony)
    with your dying breath
    You said unto me
    Will you comfort me tonight? As your ashes hit the sky
    
    Waiting for the final moments
    Watching the beloveds pain and torment
    Come to an end.  Will anyone come?
    Or am I left to experience this alone
    
    You were the inspiration to this song
    You made all the difference now youre gone
    You made all the difference now youre
    gone 
    
    Why 
    does this seem like it was meant to be
    Like
    we are wrapped up in some destiny
    Cruel
    jokes are being played on me
    I
    Am alone caught stuck in isolation
    isolation
    and now there's no time left
    you gave in to the night
    Dearly departed, The Be lo ved
    Have you gone into the light? 
    
    Waiting for the final moments
    Watching the beloveds pain and torment
    Come to an end.  Will anyone come?
    Or am I left to experience this alone
    
    You were the inspiration to this song
    You made all the difference now youre gone
    You made all the difference now youre
    gone 
    
    Unwrapping the mystery of death
    From innocence to fragility with age. 
    Where we bear child and watch them outgrow us. 
    As we Build a self sufficient machine 
    That doesn't need.  But Now we are here, Time stands still here
    For a moment. 
    
    In the wake of everlasting
    
    
    Glimpses of the future, grow old
    Does it go black? is it so cold`],

    lyrics: [true, `Have you ever seen a sunset? 
    How about a struggling flower bloom?
    Do you know true beauty? 
    That power is within you.
    Youll see you're no exception.
    Everything is a part a life
    You may feel that it's ending 
    But know the journey will go on
    
    When I feel lost and alone
    I look to the sky and just breathe
    Like the breeze piercing the trees
    Or the moon's reflection in their eye
    
    Every leaf on the tree is precious.
    Each is part of the grand design
    They recycle, feed, sustain
    For the greater good and common gain
    
    The seemingly insignificant support the 
    Greater entity, through this we see we move as one, we all call this earth place   our home
    
    When I feel lost and alone
    I look to the sky and just breathe
    Like the breeze piercing the trees
    Or the moon's reflection in their eye
    It's a sign I'm alive
    Everythings gonna be alright
    When I feel lost and alone
    I look to the sky and just breathe
    
    Dust, to dust we all will fall
    Ash, from the ashes we will rise 
    We will be reborn
    From dirt 
    Down to our earthy roots
    Can't you see? We are all the same
    It'll be that way for eternity
    
    When I feel lost and alone
    I look to the sky and just breathe
    Like the breeze piercing the trees
    Or the moon's reflection in their eye
    It's a sign we're alive
    Everythings gonna be alright
    If you feel lost and alone
    Just look to the sky and breathe
    Just breathe just breathe
    
    
    In this bitchin' Camaro
    We are all the same`],

    Realization you can't escape this fate

    The time when it was

    When I'm taken by the night
    Rest assured I'll be thinking of 
    You and I are the end of my time

    Can you hear it?
    Accept it's the end of days
    
    Do you fear it
    As it creeps in.
    It's coming for you while you're stargazed
    
    Tell me now
    Do you fear?
    Tell me now
    For your life
    Tell me now
    Is death real?
    Tell me now
    Tell me!

    Sal va tion
    As we fade to black
    
    Someone help me out of my headddd
    Someone get me out of this hell
    I'm caught inside the words of unsaid
    Telling myself this feeling is Death
    Someone help my out of this world
    Someone save me from myself 
    I'm questioning the light in my eye
    That's welcoming me to the dead
    
    Do you fear the moment when it
    All will be falling
    Down
    The impending fate you feel as it
    All comes crashing

    You'd never know by looking at me
    I am yearning for acceptance to maybe find peace
    No pride no shame, oh ive begged on my knees
    Are we friends? No, only if you do this for me
    
    I    took the fall, to feel companionated
    To those whom i gave it all
     you assured I was alienated
    So am i loved? Or am i hated?
     Or is this all inside of my head
    
    Should i stay? And if I do go
    will i take it with
    To the moment where I find death
    Will it be my last regrets
    
    its all just a part of me
    My stories make my disease
    And all this frustration 
    has taken its toll
    I'm considering now that my soul can be sold.
    To the devil
    Yes the devil I'll call
    To the devil
    Yes the devil I'll call
    
    
    Stuck inside Lies and deceit
    it's not how it's supposed to be
    When I finally take the fall
    I'll have been forgotten by all
    
    Should i stay? And if I do go
    will i take it with
    To the moment where I find death
    Will it be my last regrets
    
    its all just a part of me
    My stories make my disease
    And all this frustration 
    has taken its toll
    I'm considering now that my soul can be sold

    lyrics: [true, `I will flyyyyyyy
    With or without youuuuuu
    
    Do you know why this is happening?
    You said love was everlasting
    But it's not strong enough to stay
    Everlasting
    You said we'd be everlasting
    Till the end was erased by fraying timelines
    Now we must walk away
    And chase our destinies
    
    I will find the will to drive my soul on from this pain
    And one day, I will break away these chains
    and I will flyyyyyyy
    With or without youuuuuu
    I will fly
    
    Faced against the truth you lie, run away,
    You cry and then you panic
    Faced with opposition you vanish
    We cant be together, or ever apart
    We’re damned by love,
    Our soul strands inter-mangled from the start
    By fate we found each other, now we've lost our way
    Can you tell me now that things will ever be the same?
    At the end of it, who do you blame?
    Storybook love, now Dwindled flame
    
    Do you think of the times,
    The good ones where we'd be laughing?
    Can you say things would stay the same,
    Without me by your side?
    Do you think of the world
    And how it keeps turning
    Even when we're gone?
    
    Whyyyyyyyyyyyyy???? 
    
    I will find the will to drive my soul on from this pain
    And one day, I will break away these chains
    and I will flyyyyyyy
    With or without youuuuuu
    I will fly
